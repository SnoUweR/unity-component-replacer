## Component Replacer

This utility allows you to replace the component with another component of the same class hierarchy.
All properties that exist in both components are copied to the new component.
Therefore we can easily replace a base component with any derivative, or a derived component to another
derived component (or even to the base one) without having to connect all properties links again.
